# Cobalt2 for Prism

Cobalt2 is a theme by Wes Bos for [Sublime Text](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Theme%20-%20Cobalt2), [iTerm](https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm), [Vim](https://github.com/herrbischoff/cobalt2.vim) and many other editors. 

This is for Prism.js syntax highlighting.

## Languages Ported

I'd like to port every language, feel free to chip in and help. The colours should be taken from [this theme](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2/blob/master/cobalt2.tmTheme). I find it's easiest to open some code in the Sublime theme and try to match it as close as possible.
